             While I, am writing this, already the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic outbreak has put a huge effort into many citizens, their economy, countries economy, and a lot across the world. The best solution we came out with Social distancing and accordingly it measures the travel bans, self-quarantines, and business partially shutdown are changing the very fabric of societies worldwide. Data science could also help track scientific coronavirus misinformation and unverified rumors or opening the vision for the understanding of fear, anxiety, panic, and undoubtedly more.
            </p>
            <p class="text">
              In December 2019, COVID-19 coronavirus was first identified in the Wuhan region of China. By March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) categorized the COVID-19 outbreak as a pandemic. A lot has happened in the months in between with major outbreaks in Iran, South Korea, and Italy.

We know that COVID-19 spreads through respiratory droplets, such as through coughing, sneezing, or speaking. But, how quickly did the virus spread across the globe? And, can we see any effect from country-wide policies, like shutdowns and quarantines?.
